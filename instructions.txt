1. If you get an error about not having access to the zip file, make sure that you downloaded it to the DOCUMENTS folder, not the DOWNLOADS folder

2. Run RUNME.bat

3. If Firefox can't connect to anything, restart your computer. If that doesn't work, try again in a few hours.

4. If anything is broken in general, a fix *CAN* be made. If something is broken, wait up to 2-3 days and redownload the zip file. A notice will be posted on the download page if it is broken.
